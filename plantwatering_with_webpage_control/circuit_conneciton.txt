ðŸ”¹ Components Needed
ESP32 (3.3V logic)
BC547 NPN Transistor
1N4007 or 1N4148 Diode (for flyback protection)
1KÎ© Resistor (for transistor base)
3V Submersible Pump
3V Power Supply (Battery or Adapter)

ðŸ”§ Circuit Connections
ESP32 GPIO â†’ 1KÎ© Resistor â†’ Base of BC547 Transistor
Emitter of BC547 â†’ Ground (GND)
Collector of BC547 â†’ Negative Terminal of the Water Pump
Positive Terminal of the Pump â†’ +3V Power Source
Diode (1N4007 or 1N4148)
Cathode (| - side) â†’ +3V Power Source
Anode (| | side) â†’ Collector of BC547 (Negative of Pump)

âš¡ How It Works
When the ESP32 sets GPIO HIGH, the transistor switches ON, allowing current to flow and turning ON the pump.
When the ESP32 sets GPIO LOW, the transistor switches OFF, stopping the pump.
The diode absorbs any voltage spike generated by the pump when switching OFF, protecting the transistor.
