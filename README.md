# IOT_Plant_watering
This project is to water the plant at certain time using NTP server. Good when you are on a vacation. There are couple of stages in this project at least that is the plan.  It is gonna have all these features one by one - OTA support, webpage support, Display support, Notification support.

All the dependencies are already added in the library.

To DO -

1. Use soil mositure sensore or just connect a wire to the I/O pins to get the status of the moisture level.
2. Use two wire approach to figure out if the water tank is empty.
3. IFTTT support for reminding the water is less in the tank.
4. Add user authentication so that not everyone can have access to the webpage as anyone can control the water pump from webpage.
